            We perform a wind mitigation inspection so that you can save money
            on your homeowners insurance. It’s quite simple and in less than an
            hour you could be saving up to 86% on the wind portion of your
            homeowners insurance. This can also be known as the hurricane or
            windstorm portion of your policy. Depending on where you are located
            and who your insurance provider is, the windstorm portion of your
            insurance can be nearly 70% of your total homeowners insurance
            policy. Let’s do some math. If your paying $2,000 a year for
            homeowners insurance and 70% of that is windstorm premium, that’s
            $1,400. If you meet specific criteria, up to 86% of that amount can
            be deducted. That’s a
            <span class="savings">saving of $1,204 per year</span>!

            In 2007 the Florida Legislature approved an amendment to §627.0629
            (1) which stated “A rate filing for residential property insurance
            must include actuarially reasonable discounts, credits, or other
            rate differentials, or appropriate reductions in deductibles, for
            properties on which fixtures or construction techniques demonstrated
            to reduce the amount of loss in a windstorm have been installed or
            implemented.”

          To potentially save thousands of dollars on your home owners insurance
          you need to have a Wind Mitigation Inspection preformed by a licensed

          primary goal is to educate our clients on the benefits of wind
          mitigating features that may be applied to their home, as well as save
          them a substantial amount of money on their homeowners insurance.
          These are both things we do every day in the Tampa Bay Area.
