      "To meet Section 1, titled Building Code your home must be built after  March 1st, 2002. (In the Tampa Bay area) OR Sept 1, 1994 in the Miami-Dade County, South Florida area).",
      "To meet Section 2, titled Roof Covering, your roofing materials must meet the 2001 Florida Building Code. The only way to accomplish this is by having your roof replaced after 2001. If you have a roof replacment upcoming you may also be eligible to meet Section 7 (Secondary Water Resistance) of the form. This is because most new roofs being constructed now are being installed with a Secondary Water Resistance system.",
      "To meet Section 3, titled Roof Deck Attachment, the nailing size and pattern must meet the 2001 or newer Florida Building Code. This usually will require taking off your current roof deck and having plywood or an OSB roof attached with a minimum of 8d nails spaced 6” on the edge and 12” in the field. Older homes with dimensional 1-inch lumber also qualify as this decking is superior to plywood.",
      'To meet Section 5, titled Roof Geometry, you must have a hip roof. If you do not have a hip roof there is no other way to meet this category other than having a new roof put on your home. Which would be quite costly. See the <a href="./wind-mitigation-education.html">Wind Mitigation Education</a> section for more details about these features and exactly what is required to meet them.',

      "To meet Section 4, titled Roof to Wall Attachment you must have a metal connection between the roof truss system and the top of the wall. These are commonly called clips or straps. If you do not have them they can be added to the home by crawling around the attic and installing them, or by removing the exterior soffit and installing them from outside.",
      "The most common types are clips pictured in the first photo or straps which are pictured in the second photo. If you are lacking these you most likely have toe nails which are basic and do not qualify for any discounts. See the third photo.",

      "To meet Section 8, titled Secondary Water Resistance (SWR), your home must have a self adhering polymer modified bitumen roofing underlayment applied directly to the sheathing. This would involve replacing your roof (See Section 2 & 3).",
      "Another, yet less commonly utilized way to meet the SWR Section is by having a foam SWR applied as a secondary means to water intrusion. This involves spraying foam at the point where the truss meets the roof deck. This is not hard to do but takes some time and should be done by a licensed contractor.",

      "To meet Section 7, titled Opening Protection, you must have a system of protections for ALL the openings on your home. These openings include doors, windows, garage  doors, doggie doors and attic vents. The most common types of protections are impact rated hurricane shutters, impact rated glass windows and plywood shutters. Other coverings can include anything that is not hurricane rated, such as non-rated shutters or products that cannot be identified.",
      "Wood panels are quite easy to build and install. Homeowners with basic knowledge and tools can build wood panels to receive a small discount. These panels must meet Section 1609 and Table 1609.1.4 of the 2007 Florida Building Code to be eligible for a discount. There is a tutorial video in the education section under the impact windows button which teaches you how to build these. If you already have plywood shutters they must be on site and correctly meet the building code when we come to inspect your home to receive this discount.",
      "Hurricane rated openings are usually installed by professional contractors. These opening protections must meet the requirements of the Miami-Dade County PA 201, 202 and 203, or Florida Building Code 201, 202 and 203, or ASTM 1886 and ASTM E 1996 (Missile Level C—9 lb). To know if your storm shutters meet these ratings you should have your receipts or contracts from the installers who put them on, or you can sometimes look on the windows to see the rating codes etched in them.",
