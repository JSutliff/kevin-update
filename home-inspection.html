          Our home inspection process starts with a two to four hour visit to
          the home you are interested in buying or selling. During this time we
          look at all aspects of the home to determine what condition each of
          its features are in. If you are present during the inspection we can
          walk you through and point out any major findings and answer any
          questions you may have.
